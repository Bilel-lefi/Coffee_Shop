            Sixteen-year-old Prince Anden has no memory of the night his father
            died. People say he caused the accident; his brother the king has
            never forgiven him. Now, years later and exiled in disgrace, Anden
            receives a mysterious note. "You didn't slip. You were pushed. Your
            father didn't drown. He was murdered." Anden falls for mischievous
            palace squire River, but the timing couldnâ€™t be worse. He returns
            home to find his kingdom threatened by enemy states on all sides,
            his brother about to come of age, and their uncle the Lord Regent
            making moves to usurp the throne. Anden must race to uncover a
            decades-old conspiracy before it destroys his kingdom, his family,
            and the boy he loves.
